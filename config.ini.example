# Database to use, given as a URI understood by SQLAlchemy.
# Note: The database stores the Account id-to-key mapping. Some clients (e.g.
# certbot) will after registering assume their public key is known to Serles
# and only identify themselves through their account id. Hence, the database
# should be persistent. All other data can be ephemeral, and is purged by
# Serles regularly (/// is relative path, //// absolute. yes, really.).
# If you don't care about account keys, and given that you are running only 1
# process and 1 thread, you can use an in-memory database by setting it to
# "sqlite:///:memory:".
database = sqlite:////etc/serles/db.sqlite
# Mariadb is also supported, but you will need to install pymysql from pypi.

# defaults to Backend. supports relative imports.
